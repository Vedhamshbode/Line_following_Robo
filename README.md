# Line_following_Robo
A typical line follower robot has two sets of motors, let's call them left
motor and right motor. Both motors rotate on the basis of the signal
received from the left and the right sensors respectively. The robot
needs to perform 4 sets of motion which includes moving forward,
turning left, turning right and coming to a halt. The description about
the cases are given below.
