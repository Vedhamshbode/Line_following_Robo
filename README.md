# Line Following Robot

## Overview

This project involves designing and building a basic line-following robot using an Arduino platform. The robot is designed to follow a line of a specified width and is capable of basic autonomous navigation along a predefined path. This type of robot is ideal for applications such as automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in warehouses or assembly lines, where precise navigation along a track is essential.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Board**: [Specify model, e.g., Arduino Uno]
- **IR Sensors**: For line detection
- **Motors**: DC motors or servo motors for movement
- **Motor Driver Module**: For controlling the motors
- **Power Supply**: Battery or external power source
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**: For circuit connections
- **Miscellaneous**: Resistors, capacitors, etc.

## Circuit Diagram

The circuit diagram for the line-following robot is available in the `circuit_diagram.pdf` file. This diagram shows how the components are connected to the Arduino board, including the IR sensors and motor driver module.

## Implementation

### Firmware

The Arduino sketch for the line-following robot is included in the `line_following_robot.ino` file. This code reads the sensor inputs, processes them to determine the robot's position relative to the line, and adjusts the motor speeds accordingly to follow the line.

### Features

- **Line Detection**: Utilizes IR sensors to detect the line and distinguish it from the background.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Adjusts motor speeds to keep the robot following the line.
- **Basic Control Algorithm**: Implements a simple proportional control algorithm to correct deviations from the line.

## How to Use

1. **Assemble the Hardware**: Connect the components according to the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload Firmware**: Load the `line_following_robot.ino` sketch onto the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Power the Robot**: Ensure the robot is powered either through a battery or an external power source.
4. **Calibration**: Adjust sensor thresholds and motor parameters if needed for optimal performance.

## Enhancements

To improve the efficiency and functionality of the robot, consider the following enhancements:

- **Advanced Sensors**: Use more sophisticated sensors or multiple sensors to improve line detection accuracy.
- **Optimized Control Algorithm**: Implement more advanced control algorithms, such as PID control, for smoother and more precise navigation.
- **Adaptive Techniques**: Incorporate adaptive methods to handle varying line widths and surface conditions.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Integrate real-time feedback mechanisms for dynamic adjustments during operation.
